Linking the github repository with an android based application

Since there is no official mobile application for Github,
we have tried integrating github with a mobile application.
Githubâ€™s API is available for free download, using
which we have created a login page for your Github
account through which once logged in,the user can
manage there project repository completely using our
application.Comment on a threat,create an issue and
